I’m a self-taught Platform Engineer with 3+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and high performance applications across the full stack. Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master of Information Technology (AI Specialisation)** at **La Trobe University**, Melbourne. Most of my work revolves around **Node.js, NestJS, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and cloud-native microservices**. I enjoy designing clean architectures, improving developer workflows, and building systems that genuinely help people.
